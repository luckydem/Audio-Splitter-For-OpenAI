**Date**: 2025-08-04 22:45 UTC  
**Service URL**: https://audio-splitter-ey3mdkeuya-uc.a.run.app

## Deployed Changes Summary

### 1. **Timeout Configuration** ✅
- Cloud Run timeout: **3600 seconds (60 minutes)**
- OpenAI API timeout: **600 seconds (10 minutes)**
- FFmpeg timeout: **600 seconds (10 minutes)**

### 2. **Performance Optimizations** ✅
- Parallel workers: **8 (increased from 6)**
- WAV chunk size: **5MB (reduced from 10MB)**
- FFmpeg threading: **2 threads per operation**
- Connection pooling: **10 total, 5 per host**

### 3. **Reliability Improvements** ✅
- Retry logic: **5 attempts with exponential backoff [2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s]**
- Connection pooling for all OpenAI API calls
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 4. **Resource Configuration** ✅
- CPU: **8 vCPUs**
- Memory: **8GB RAM**
- Max instances: **100**
- Concurrency: **10 requests per instance**

## Code Changes Applied

1. `src/audio_splitter_drive.py`:
   - Added retry decorator with exponential backoff
   - Increased timeouts for all API operations
   - Added connection pooling
   - Reduced WAV chunk size limit to 5MB
   - Increased parallel workers to 8

2. `src/split_audio.py`:
   - Added FFmpeg timeout configuration (600s)
   - Added multi-threading support for FFmpeg
   - Optimized chunk size limits

3. `cloudbuild.yaml`:
   - Set timeout to 3600 seconds

4. `deployment/deploy.sh`:
   - Added --timeout=3600 to service update

## Ready for Testing

The service is fully deployed and ready for testing with large audio files. Expected improvements:

- Files up to ~60 minutes should process without timeout
- Faster chunk processing with 8 parallel workers
- Better recovery from transient network errors
- Reduced FFmpeg timeouts with smaller WAV chunks

**Test with your problematic audio file to verify the fixes are working!**
